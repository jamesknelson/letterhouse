# Why I haven't written for a couple months

Other than being starting and quitting a job, my writing nemesis from the past has also re-appeared.

I want there to be low friction to writing, without paying large fees in time or money to host a secure WordPress installation, and without giving control of my platform to somebody else who will inevitably harm my readers by trying to take their time, money, or both.

I want to be able to easily write on any of my devices, and publish it to a cost-effective platform that I control.

And it seems this problem is going to keep nerd-sniping me each time I start writing, so I've resolved to solve it â€“ for myself, if not for everyone else.

It's going to take a long while to implement a fix I'm happy with, but I understand by now that I need to focus on getting something online as soon as possible. So that's what I'm doing.
